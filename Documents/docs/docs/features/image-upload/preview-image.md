# Preview Image

CodeBRT allows users to preview images in the chat or in input fields.

1. After uploading an image, or sending an image to chat, you can preview the image by clicking on the image.

   ![Click Image](/img/image-upload/click-image.png)

2. This is useful if you want to see the image in full size, or rotate the image. (Well, I am not sure why you would want to do that, but you can.)

   ![Preview Image](/img/image-upload/full-preview-image.png)

   :::note
   This modification is only visible to you. This is not affecting the original image in the chat.
