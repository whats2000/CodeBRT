# Image Upload

CodeBRT allows users to upload images to the chat.
This feature is useful when debugging visual information.

:::note
An important note about image uploads is that the images are stored in extension storage.
To reduce the cost of the token, the images only used in the latest use message.

Please give me feedback if you have any suggestions or concerns about this feature.
