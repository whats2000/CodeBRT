## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Coding Standards

1. **Code Formatting**
   - Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Run `prettier --write` before committing changes

2. **Function Styles**
   - Prefer arrow functions throughout the project
   ```typescript
   // Preferred
   const myFunction = (param: string) => {
     // Function body
   };
   ```

3. **Project Structure**
   The project is organized into specific modules:

   - `src/api/`: Handles registration and interface between frontend and backend
     - `index.ts`: Export necessary classes and functions
     - Contains module-specific types, constants, and utilities

   - `src/integrations/`: Manages IDE control and interactions
     - `index.ts`: Export necessary classes and functions
     - Contains module-specific types, constants, and utilities

   - `src/services/`: Implements connectors and complex handling logic
     - `index.ts`: Export necessary classes and functions
     - Contains module-specific types, constants, and utilities

4. **Shared Resources**
   - Global types, constants, and utilities are located under `src/types/`, `src/constants/`, and `src/utils/`
   - Use these for resources that are used across multiple modules

5. **Testing**
   - Write test cases for your implementations
   - Tests are located in `tests/` under the `src` directory
   - Ensure good test coverage to aid in debugging and maintaining code quality

### Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages should follow a specific format that clearly describes the type of change:

- `Add:` For adding a new function or feature
  ```
  Add: Add new XML parsing utility function
  ```

- `Feat:` For changing or enhancing existing functionality
  ```
  Feat: Improve error handling in API module
  ```

- `Fix:` For resolving bugs or issues
  ```
  Fix: Resolve memory leak in service connector
  ```

- `Update:` For updating source code, documentation, or dependencies
  ```
  Update: Refactor code structure for better readability
  ```

#### Commit Message Structure
1. Start with the type of change (`Add:`, `Feat:`, `Fix:`, `Update:`)
2. Provide a clear, concise description
3. Optionally add more detailed explanation in the commit body

### Reviewing Process
